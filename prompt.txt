Combining with this threshold.py, I want you to draw a threshold line decided by this threshold program for each type in each block. Do not eliminate the variables below the threshold, just draw the threshold line:
```
import csv
import numpy as np


# Function to calculate entropy statistics for each variable type within each block
def calculate_variable_type_entropy_statistics(input_file):
    block_variable_statistics = {}
    with open(input_file, newline="") as infile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
        for row in reader:
            block_id = row["Block_ID"]
            variable_type = row["Type"]
            entropy = float(row["Entropy"])
            if block_id not in block_variable_statistics:
                block_variable_statistics[block_id] = {}
            if variable_type not in block_variable_statistics[block_id]:
                block_variable_statistics[block_id][variable_type] = []
            block_variable_statistics[block_id][variable_type].append(entropy)

    block_variable_thresholds = {}
    for block_id, variable_statistics in block_variable_statistics.items():
        block_variable_thresholds[block_id] = {}
        for variable_type, entropies in variable_statistics.items():
            mean_entropy = np.mean(entropies)
            std_dev_entropy = np.std(entropies)
            threshold = mean_entropy + std_dev_entropy
            block_variable_thresholds[block_id][variable_type] = threshold
    return block_variable_thresholds


# Function to filter out low entropy variables for each variable type within each block
def filter_variables_by_variable_type(input_file, output_file, thresholds):
    with open(input_file, newline="") as infile, open(
        output_file, "w", newline=""
    ) as outfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
        fieldnames = reader.fieldnames
        writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()

        for row in reader:
            block_id = row["Block_ID"]
            variable_type = row["Type"]
            entropy = float(row["Entropy"])
            threshold = thresholds[block_id].get(
                variable_type, 0
            )  # Default to 0 if threshold is not found
            if entropy >= threshold:
                writer.writerow(row)


# Main function
def main():
    input_file = "entropy\csv_parser_entropy.csv"
    output_file = "entropy_preprocessed\csv_parser_filtered_entropy.csv"

    # Calculate block-wise variable type entropy statistics
    block_variable_thresholds = calculate_variable_type_entropy_statistics(input_file)
    print("Block-wise Variable Type Thresholds:", block_variable_thresholds)

    # Filter variables for each variable type within each block based on calculated thresholds
    filter_variables_by_variable_type(
        input_file, output_file, block_variable_thresholds
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
